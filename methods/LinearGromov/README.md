## A New Way to Regularize the GW Problem
In this work, we propose to regularize the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) problem by constraining the admissible couplings to have a low-nonnegative rank: we call it the Low-Rank Gromov-Wasserstein (LR-GW) Problem. In the following figure, we compare the couplings obtained by the Prior Art method based on an entropic regularization and ours.

Our regularization can take also advantage of the geometry of the problem, in particular when the cost matrices involved in the GW problem admits a low-rank factorization. In this case, our method is able to compute the the LR-GW cost in linear time with respect to the number of samples. We present the time-accuracy tradeoff between different methods when the samples are drawn from two anisotropic Gaussian blobs of 5 or 20 clusters in 10D and 15D,
endowed with the squared Euclidean distance  with n = m = 10000 samples.

In this [file](https://github.com/meyerscetbon/LinearGromov/blob/main/toy_examples.py) we provide some toy examples where we compare the Entropic GW scheme with our proposed method. 

This repository contains a Python implementation of the algorithms presented in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.01128.pdf).
